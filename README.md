# Local Library - Java/Spring

Based on the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Tutorial_local_library_website">MDN Express (Node) Local Library</a>, I decided to make my own implementation of the project using Java, Spring and ReactJs. The main goal in making a version of my own of this project is to not copy and paste the original code, but take that concept and write the code myself to get the expected result in the project.
